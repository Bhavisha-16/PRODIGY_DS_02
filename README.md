Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an exploration of the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes information about passengers aboard the Titanic, such as their demographics, ticket class, cabin, and whether they survived or not. Through data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), this project aims to uncover relationships between variables, identify patterns, and extract insights from the data.
